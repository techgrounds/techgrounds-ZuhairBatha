# [loops]
[are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.]

## Key-terms
* For loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.
* while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is True.

## Opdracht
# Exercise 1:
 - Create a new script.
 - Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
 - Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.
# Exercise 2:
 - Create a new script.
 - Copy the code below into your script.
for i in range(10):
#do something here

 - Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
 - Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
 - Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.
 # Exercise 3:
 - Create a new script.
 - Copy the array below into your script.
arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]

 - Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
