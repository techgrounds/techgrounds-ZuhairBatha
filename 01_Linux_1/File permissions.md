## Opdracht
- 1-Create a text file.
- 2-Make a long listing to view the file's permissions. Who is the file's owner and group? What kind of permissions does the file have?
- 3-Make the file executable by adding the execute permission(x).
- 4 Remove the read and write permissions (rw) from the file for the group and everyone else, but not for the owner. Can you still read it?
- 5-Change the owner of the file to a different user. If everything went well, you shouldn't be able to read the file unless you assume root privileges with 'sudo'.
- 6-Change the group ownership of the file to a different group.
