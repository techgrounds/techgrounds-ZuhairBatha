# [Symmetric]
[is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message.]

## Key-terms
[AESencryption]

## Opdracht
- 1-Find one more historic cipher besides the Caesar cipher.
-  The Vigenère cipher (French pronunciation: [viʒnɛːʁ]) is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key.
- 2-Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.
  - AES is one of the most frequently used algorithms. It is fast, with a variable key length option that gives it extra security. It is ideal when handling large amounts of encrypted data.
  - RSA is een asymmetrisch encryptiealgoritme,Since its speed isn’t convenient for processing large amounts of data, RSA encryption is mostly used in digital signatures, email encryption, SSL/TLS certificates, and browsers.
- 3-Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel.They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other Communication channels besides the public Slack channel. analyse the shortcomings of symmetric encryption for sending message
